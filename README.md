# PHPLoversBlog
Description: This blog project is much more advanced than the earlier projects.

We create a fairly large blogging system. We create an admin section to add posts, delete posts as well as update them. We take our first look at using libraries and classes in OOP as we create a completely custom MySQLi Database class. We also create custom helper functions.

Features/Technologies:
PHP OOP, PHPMyAdmin, MySQL CRUD, Loops, Superglobals (GET, POST), Associative Arrays, Bootstrap Framework
